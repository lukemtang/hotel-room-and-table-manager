<h2> What is this? <h2>
<p> This is a work in progress Java application designed to act as a system for hotel staff to accept bookings and assign them to rooms. It is inspired by my own experience working in a hotel. <p>
<p> The first part of the application will contain the interface that will allow guest data to be inputted and then stored.<p>
<p> The second part contains a system to seat guests at the hotel restaurant and to synchronise food and beverage charges with their account. <p>
